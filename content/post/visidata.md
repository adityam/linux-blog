Normally, I don't have to deal with large spreadsheets. I do use simple
spreadsheets for keeping track of budgets/investments/taxes etc., but the only
big spreadsheets I encounter are sifting through all applicants for hiring
students and assigning grades to students. I struggle through OpenOffice Calc
to work through these, because navigating spreadsheets is too slow.

I recently came across a recommendation for [visidata][vd] in a thread of
HackerNews, and it certainly looks like a program that I should checkout the
next time I need to work through a big spreadsheet. 

Note: The  python package `openpyxl` needs to be installed to work with excel
files.
