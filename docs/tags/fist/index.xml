      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post, I started using fish after using zsh for about 15 years. After working exclusively on fish for about 3 months, I am now back to zsh.
In the end, there was nothing inherently missing in fish, but fish just did a few minor things differently which began to get annoying.
 Fish&amp;rsquo;s tab-completion first shows a short list of option (top 10 or so) and you have to press tab twice to see the whole list.</description>
