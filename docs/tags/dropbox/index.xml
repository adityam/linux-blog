      <title>Backup up data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For about 10 years now, I have been using Dropbox as a tool to synchronize data
between my work desktop and my laptop. I do a local backup using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rsnapshot.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsnapshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they were only stored locally on my desktop. So,
effectively, I had been relying on Dropbox as a backup solution. Every so
often, I read horror stories that &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dropbox+is+not+a+backup+solution&#34;&gt;Dropbox is not a backup solution&lt;/a&gt;.
And every time I would read one of these reports, I would think, &amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; maybe
I should start using a proper backup solution.&amp;rdquo; I finally bit the bullet and
purchased some storage from &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsync.net&#34;&gt;rsync.net&lt;/a&gt; and set up a back up
system. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Syncing using rclone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a Dropbox user for over a decade. Part of the attraction for me
was that it is one of the few synchronization services that fully supports
Linux. I had it installed on two servers, my office desktop, my laptop, and
most of my mobile devices. Couple of years ago, my employer moved most of its
IT services with Microsoft 365, which gives me access to storage space on
Microsoft OneDrive as well. Plus, I have purchased additional storage on
Google (for backing up my personal photos). But I never seriously used
Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive for synchronization because all my computers
run Linux and neither of these services had a Linux client.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
