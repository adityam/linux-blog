      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a Dropbox user for over a decade. Part of the attraction for me
was that it is one of the few synchronization services that fully supports
Linux. I had it installed on two servers, my office desktop, my laptop, and
most of my mobile devices. Couple of years ago, my employer moved most of its
IT services with Microsoft 365, which gives me access to storage space on
Microsoft OneDrive as well. Plus, I have purchased additional storage on
Google (for backing up my personal photos). But I never seriously used
Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive for synchronization because all my computers
run Linux and neither of these services had a Linux client.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
