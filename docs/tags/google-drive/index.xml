      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a Dropbox user for over a decade. Part of the attraction for me&#xA;was that it is one of the few synchronization services that fully supports&#xA;Linux. I had it installed on two servers, my office desktop, my laptop, and&#xA;most of my mobile devices. Couple of years ago, my employer moved most of its&#xA;IT services with Microsoft 365, which gives me access to storage space on&#xA;Microsoft OneDrive as well. Plus, I have purchased additional storage on&#xA;Google (for backing up my personal photos). But I never seriously used&#xA;Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive for synchronization because all my computers&#xA;run Linux and neither of these services had a Linux client.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
