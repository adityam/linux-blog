      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been cycling between web browsers for the last few years. I used to use
Opera, but then it became a shell for Chrome, then I started using Chromium,
but occasonally got huge memory consumption, then I started using Firefox, but
lately it has become very laggy (to the extent that even scrolling was slow).
So, after testing a bunch of less commonly used browsers, I have finally
settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://qutebrowser.org/&#34;&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
