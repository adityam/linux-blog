      <title>Converting SuperNote files to PDF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is my primary mode of note taking and at the beginning of the
pandemic, I switched from paper notebooks to digital notebooks. My primary
notetaking devices are SuperNote A6X, Boox Max3, and iPad Pro using Notability
App (in that order,
though I do prefer iPad for reviewing papers etc. because of the speed). I
prefer the writing experience on Supernote, but I do miss one of the software
features of Boox: In Boox, everytime I save a note file, it is automatically
converted to PDF and stored in a pdf directory which mirrors the layout of the
notes directory. There is no such feature in SuperNote. Notes have to
converted manually and get exported to a flat directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Backup up data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For about 10 years now, I have been using Dropbox as a tool to synchronize data
between my work desktop and my laptop. I do a local backup using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rsnapshot.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsnapshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they were only stored locally on my desktop. So,
effectively, I had been relying on Dropbox as a backup solution. Every so
often, I read horror stories that &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dropbox+is+not+a+backup+solution&#34;&gt;Dropbox is not a backup solution&lt;/a&gt;.
And every time I would read one of these reports, I would think, &amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; maybe
I should start using a proper backup solution.&amp;rdquo; I finally bit the bullet and
purchased some storage from &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsync.net&#34;&gt;rsync.net&lt;/a&gt; and set up a back up
system. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
