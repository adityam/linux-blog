<h1>Changing terminal and browser</h1>
<p class="post-time">Posted on May 24, 2022</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time on the terminal: using alpine to send emails and using
vim/neovim to edit tex files and code. For at least a decade if not longer, I
have been using UXTerm as my terminal emulator. At some stage I spent some
time configuring UXTerm fonts and color schemes to what I like, and I have
been using it ever since. Recently, I started experiencing some weird issues
with UXTerm, which forced me down a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I did not use my office workstation for almost a year and a half due to covid.
When I returned back, I did a system update, and started working. But every so
often (once an hour or so), I started seeing weird flickering of the terminal.
This was particularly common when I was composing emails (neovim open inside
alpine). Most of the times, this scrolling stopped on pressing <code>CTRL-L</code> but it
was annoying to say the least. I tried searching online for what was
happening, but could not find a solution that worked. Surprisingly, my laptop,
which has the same distro and the same setup never had an isse.</p>

<p>Anyways, I thought that it was time to try out a new terminal emulator. After
reading a bit about the different options, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/n9noje/alacritty_vs_kitty/gxqne6n">this post</a> of the
notcurses author convinced me to test <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>
first. After spending half an hour going over the documentation, I could
configure everything (fonts, colorscheme, copy and paste behavior) as I liked.
I have been using it on my office workstation for 3-4 hours and no more
flickering.</p>

<p>The story would have ended with &ldquo;and they lived happily ever after&rdquo;, until I
noticed that images where not displayed when viewing HTML emails in alpine. I
am sure you are screaming, &ldquo;What!&rdquo;. So, let me take a step back and explain.</p>

<p>I use alpine (which is a text based email program) for reading emails.
Occasionally, I get an email which has some images or HTML formatting (such as
tables), which doesn&rsquo;t display nicely in alpine. In such cases, I simply do
&lsquo;V&rsquo; + &lsquo;Down-Arrow&rsquo; + &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; to display the <code>text/html</code> portion of the email.
I have configured my <code>mailcap</code> file to display <code>text/html</code> using <code>w3m</code>, which
is a text-based browser which can display inline images in the terminal. The
inline image display of <code>w3m</code> was not working on kitty.</p>

<p>Back to DuckDuckGo. There was <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/851">an issue</a> on kitty&rsquo;s github page where
the author essentially said that w3m uses a hack to display images in the
terminal and he is not going to support that hack. So, time to see if there
are any other text-based browsers that are still maintained and support inline
images.</p>

<p>In the past I had used <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">lynx</a>, but that doesn&rsquo;t support inline images.
<a href="http://www.elinks.cz/">elinks</a> hasn&rsquo;t been updated in almost a decade, but <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">links</a> is
actively maintained and supports inline images!</p>

<p>So, I installed <code>links</code> using <code>pacman -S links</code> and tried to open a website
with images:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$links -g &lt;website&gt;
Graphics not enabled when compiling</code></pre>
<p>Hmm&hellip;, so I downloaded the <code>PKGBUILD</code> of links using</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>asp checkout links</code></pre>
<p>and realized that <code>links</code> <a href="https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/blob/f86750a7ef66c071873cb580de45d03b9fd13cac/trunk/PKGBUILD#L35-L50">PKGBUILD does something unusual</a>. It first compiles
the package with graphics support, renames the executable as <code>xlinks</code> and then
recompiles without graphics support. So, all I needed to do was use <code>xlinks
-g</code> in my <code>mailcap</code>. But &hellip; that opens a new X window to display the results!
So, effectively <code>xlinks -g</code> is a lightweight browser.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that I did not notice that <code>links -g</code> is a graphical
browser rather than a text browser until I wrote this blog post. The reason is
that I use a tiling windows manager (i3m) and normally the workspace where I
am running alpine is two columns of windows: one with email and another
terminal and the other with slack and a few other terminal. Both columns are
in stacked mode. So, when <code>xlinks -g</code> opened a new X window, it completely
covered alpine and I thought that the content was being displayed as part of
alpine.</p>

<p>Now, the reason that I pipe email messages to a text-based browser rather than
firefox is to keep distractions in check. Typically, with text based browsers,
I just read the message and don&rsquo;t start browsing the web. I am going to see if
I can maintain the same distraction free habit with <code>xlinks</code>. If not, then
I&rsquo;ll be back to square one.</p>
