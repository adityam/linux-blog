      <title>Converting SuperNote files to PDF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is my primary mode of note taking and at the beginning of the
pandemic, I switched from paper notebooks to digital notebooks. My primary
notetaking devices are SuperNote A6X, Boox Max3, and iPad Pro using Notability
App (in that order,
though I do prefer iPad for reviewing papers etc. because of the speed). I
prefer the writing experience on Supernote, but I do miss one of the software
features of Boox: In Boox, everytime I save a note file, it is automatically
converted to PDF and stored in a pdf directory which mirrors the layout of the
notes directory. There is no such feature in SuperNote. Notes have to
converted manually and get exported to a flat directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Signing PDFs via command line</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/signing-pdf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Signing PDFs in Linux is always a PITA. Part of the reason is that Adobe
stopped the development of a linux port of Adobe Reader since adobe reader v9.
Some of the newer PDFs require features which are newer than acrobat v9 and
cannot be opened or signed with acrobat v9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this page, I summarize some of the options for signing PDF that have worked
for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Local config for kitty</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/kitty-local-config/</link>

      <description>As I mentioned in the last post, I am testing out kitty as my terminal emulator instead of UXTerm. So for everything has been smooth sailing except for one minor issue. On my work desktop, I want fontsize 11 but on my laptop, I want fontsize 14. This is a combination of resolution and physical size of the two monitors. Reading the documentation of kitty.conf, it was not clear how to set conditional values for the variables.</description>

      <title>Changing terminal and browser</title>

      <description>I spend a lot of time on the terminal: using alpine to send emails and using vim/neovim to edit tex files and code. For at least a decade if not longer, I have been using UXTerm as my terminal emulator. At some stage I spent some time configuring UXTerm fonts and color schemes to what I like, and I have been using it ever since. Recently, I started experiencing some weird issues with UXTerm, which forced me down a rabbit hole.</description>

      <title>Testing out Visidata</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/visidata/</link>

      <description>Normally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with large spreadsheets. I do use simple spreadsheets for keeping track of budgets/investments/taxes etc., but the only big spreadsheets I encounter are sifting through all applicants for hiring students and assigning grades to students. I struggle through OpenOffice Calc to work through these, because navigating spreadsheets is too slow.
I recently came across a recommendation for visidata in a thread of HackerNews, and it certainly looks like a program that I should checkout the next time I need to work through a big spreadsheet.</description>

      <title>Testing out qutebrowser</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been cycling between web browsers for the last few years. I used to use
Opera, but then it became a shell for Chrome, then I started using Chromium,
but occasonally got huge memory consumption, then I started using Firefox, but
lately it has become very laggy (to the extent that even scrolling was slow).
So, after testing a bunch of less commonly used browsers, I have finally
settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://qutebrowser.org/&#34;&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Slack from the terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In rencent years, lot of my short conversations with my research lab has moved
to Slack. I am not a big fan of closed protocol communication clients, but
Slack has the advantage that it is relatively easy to use. Well, it seems that
it relatively easy to use for everyone except me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Backup up data</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/backing-up-data/</link>

      <guid>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/backing-up-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For about 10 years now, I have been using Dropbox as a tool to synchronize data
between my work desktop and my laptop. I do a local backup using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rsnapshot.org&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsnapshot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they were only stored locally on my desktop. So,
effectively, I had been relying on Dropbox as a backup solution. Every so
often, I read horror stories that &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dropbox+is+not+a+backup+solution&#34;&gt;Dropbox is not a backup solution&lt;/a&gt;.
And every time I would read one of these reports, I would think, &amp;ldquo;Hmm&amp;hellip; maybe
I should start using a proper backup solution.&amp;rdquo; I finally bit the bullet and
purchased some storage from &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsync.net&#34;&gt;rsync.net&lt;/a&gt; and set up a back up
system. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tale of two eink notebooks</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/tale-of-two-eink-notebooks/</link>

      <guid>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/tale-of-two-eink-notebooks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a pen and paper person. On a typical day, I write about 10&amp;ndash;30
handwritten pages. (I write on a half-folded printer paper, so it is actually
only 7-15 pages &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; pages). For the last decade or so, I have written
almost exclusively using fountain pens (Pelikan M200, Pilot Vanishing Point,
and occasionally, Pilot Metropolitan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce the amount of time I state at a screen, I purchased a &lt;a href=&#34;https://onyxboox.com/boox_max3&#34;&gt;Oynx Boox
Max3&lt;/a&gt; tablet almost a year ago, primarily to read academic PDFs. The
13.3&amp;quot; screen of Max3 is perfect for reading dense IEEE formatted two-column
PDFs. Max3 is an Android device and many Android apps work reasonably well on
it. So, I ended up using it for internet browsing, reading emails and Slack
messages, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/ereader/comments/fnxkep/using_boox_max3_as_a_whiteboard_for_teaching/&#34;&gt;delivering zoom lectures&lt;/a&gt;, and even watching Youtube videos!
Clearly, J.K. Rowling had Max3 in mind when she described the newspapers with
moving pictures in Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
