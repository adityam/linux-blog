      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an academic, I need to track research funds: what is the remaining balance of each grant, how much I have committed for student stipends, what are anticipated expenditures for conference travel, etc. Like everyone else, I used to do this via a spreadsheet, but my spreadsheet was becoming a bit too complicated. So, I decided to try plain text accounting, and use &lt;a href=&#34;https://hledger.org/&#34;&gt;hledger&lt;/a&gt; to keep tracks of research funds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hledger&lt;/code&gt; may be considered as a Haskell port of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ledger-cli.org/&#34;&gt;ledger&lt;/a&gt;, though there are a few subtle &lt;a href=&#34;https://hledger.org/ledger.html&#34;&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; between the two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions was to come up with a sensible way to manage&#xA;my dotfiles. I evaluated a few solutions and finally settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/&#34;&gt;GNU&#xA;stow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Converting SuperNote files to PDF</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/converting-supernote-files-to-pdf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is my primary mode of note taking and at the beginning of the&#xA;pandemic, I switched from paper notebooks to digital notebooks. My primary&#xA;note taking devices are SuperNote A6X, Boox Max3, and iPad Pro using Notability&#xA;App (in that order,&#xA;though I do prefer iPad for reviewing papers etc. because of the speed). I&#xA;prefer the writing experience on Supernote, but I do miss one of the software&#xA;features of Boox: In Boox, every time I save a note file, it is automatically&#xA;converted to PDF and stored in a pdf directory which mirrors the layout of the&#xA;notes directory. There is no such feature in SuperNote. Notes have to&#xA;converted manually and get exported to a flat directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Signing PDFs via command line</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/signing-pdf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Signing PDFs in Linux is always a PITA. Part of the reason is that Adobe&#xA;stopped the development of a linux port of Adobe Reader since adobe reader v9.&#xA;Some of the newer PDFs require features which are newer than acrobat v9 and&#xA;cannot be opened or signed with acrobat v9.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this page, I summarize some of the options for signing PDF that have worked&#xA;for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Local config for kitty</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/kitty-local-config/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the last &lt;a href=&#34;../changing-terminal-and-browser&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I am&#xA;testing out &lt;a href=&#34;https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/&#34;&gt;kitty&lt;/a&gt; as my terminal emulator instead of UXTerm. So for&#xA;everything has been smooth sailing except for one minor issue. On my work&#xA;desktop, I want fontsize 11 but on my laptop, I want fontsize 14. This is a combination of resolution and physical size of the two monitors. Reading the documentation of kitty.conf, it was not clear how to set conditional values for the variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Changing terminal and browser</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time on the terminal: using alpine to send emails and using&#xA;vim/neovim to edit tex files and code. For at least a decade if not longer, I&#xA;have been using UXTerm as my terminal emulator. At some stage I spent some&#xA;time configuring UXTerm fonts and color schemes to what I like, and I have&#xA;been using it ever since. Recently, I started experiencing some weird issues&#xA;with UXTerm, which forced me down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing out Visidata</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Normally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with large spreadsheets. I do use simple&#xA;spreadsheets for keeping track of budgets/investments/taxes etc., but the only&#xA;big spreadsheets I encounter are sifting through all applicants for hiring&#xA;students and assigning grades to students. I struggle through OpenOffice Calc&#xA;to work through these, because navigating spreadsheets is too slow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a recommendation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.visidata.org/&#34;&gt;visidata&lt;/a&gt; in a thread of&#xA;HackerNews, and it certainly looks like a program that I should checkout the&#xA;next time I need to work through a big spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing out qutebrowser</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been cycling between web browsers for the last few years. I used to use&#xA;Opera, but then it became a shell for Chrome, then I started using Chromium,&#xA;but occasonally got huge memory consumption, then I started using Firefox, but&#xA;lately it has become very laggy (to the extent that even scrolling was slow).&#xA;So, after testing a bunch of less commonly used browsers, I have finally&#xA;settled on &lt;a href=&#34;https://qutebrowser.org/&#34;&gt;qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Slack from the terminal</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/slack-tui/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In rencent years, lot of my short conversations with my research lab has moved&#xA;to Slack. I am not a big fan of closed protocol communication clients, but&#xA;Slack has the advantage that it is relatively easy to use. Well, it seems that&#xA;it relatively easy to use for everyone except me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
