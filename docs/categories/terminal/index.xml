      <description>As I mentioned in a previous post, I started using fish after using zsh for about 15 years. After working exclusively on fish for about 3 months, I am now back to zsh.
In the end, there was nothing inherently missing in fish, but fish just did a few minor things differently which began to get annoying.
 Fish&amp;rsquo;s tab-completion first shows a short list of option (top 10 or so) and you have to press tab twice to see the whole list.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as my shell for almost 15 years. I spent ages
configuring it in the beginning and for the most part I have been happy with
my setup. Lately, I saw multiple suggestions for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions&#34;&gt;zsh-autosuggestions&lt;/a&gt;, which
has a tag-line &amp;ldquo;Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh&amp;rdquo;. Imitation is the best form
of flattery. So, I thought of giving fish a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
