      <title>Signing PDFs via command line</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Signing PDFs in Linux is always a PITA. Part of the reason is that Adobe
stopped the development of a linux port of Adobe Reader since adobe reader v9.
Some of the newer PDFs require features which are newer than acrobat v9 and
cannot be opened or signed with acrobat v9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this page, I summarize some of the options for signing PDF that have worked
for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Local config for kitty</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/linux-blog/post/kitty-local-config/</link>

      <description>As I mentioned in the last post, I am testing out kitty as my terminal emulator instead of UXTerm. So for everything has been smooth sailing except for one minor issue. On my work desktop, I want fontsize 11 but on my laptop, I want fontsize 14. This is a combination of resolution and physical size of the two monitors. Reading the documentation of kitty.conf, it was not clear how to set conditional values for the variables.</description>

      <title>Changing terminal and browser</title>

      <description>I spend a lot of time on the terminal: using alpine to send emails and using vim/neovim to edit tex files and code. For at least a decade if not longer, I have been using UXTerm as my terminal emulator. At some stage I spent some time configuring UXTerm fonts and color schemes to what I like, and I have been using it ever since. Recently, I started experiencing some weird issues with UXTerm, which forced me down a rabbit hole.</description>

      <title>Testing out Visidata</title>

      <description>Normally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with large spreadsheets. I do use simple spreadsheets for keeping track of budgets/investments/taxes etc., but the only big spreadsheets I encounter are sifting through all applicants for hiring students and assigning grades to students. I struggle through OpenOffice Calc to work through these, because navigating spreadsheets is too slow.
I recently came across a recommendation for visidata in a thread of HackerNews, and it certainly looks like a program that I should checkout the next time I need to work through a big spreadsheet.</description>

      <title>Using Slack from the terminal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In rencent years, lot of my short conversations with my research lab has moved
to Slack. I am not a big fan of closed protocol communication clients, but
Slack has the advantage that it is relatively easy to use. Well, it seems that
it relatively easy to use for everyone except me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trying Fish Shell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as my shell for almost 15 years. I spent ages
configuring it in the beginning and for the most part I have been happy with
my setup. Lately, I saw multiple suggestions for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions&#34;&gt;zsh-autosuggestions&lt;/a&gt;, which
has a tag-line &amp;ldquo;Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh&amp;rdquo;. Imitation is the best form
of flattery. So, I thought of giving fish a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
